<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an amateur web developer, currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br />
   As a college student, I am passionate about web development and continuously <br />
   improving my skills.</p>

<p>To enhance my web development abilities, I believe in constant practice. I donâ€™t <br />
  subscribe to the saying "practice makes perfect." Instead, I believe that practice <br />
  helps us learn, grow, and become better over time.</p>

<p>I'm excited to explore new technologies, build creative projects, and challenge <br />
  myself to improve every day. My goal is to develop clean, user-friendly, and functional<br />
   websites while expanding my knowledge in front-end and back-end development.</p>
